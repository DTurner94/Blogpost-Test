            <h2 class="contentheading">3 Reasons Why Pokemon Now Sucks</h2>
            <h3>#1 - <u>Empty Exploration</u>:</h3>
            <p>If you've played old school pokemon games (gen 1 thru 4) then you've play a true pokemon games. 
                With twists and turns around every corner, wondering if that rock in your path is a Geodude or Graveler that wants to fight, or if the trainer turning quickly is friend or foe. 
                These days the worlds feel hollow and empty, despite the worlds being bigger than ever, they're so small. 
                Dungeons and caves are near straight paths, with little reason for their existance other than to say "I am dungeon, where Pokemon reside."  </p>
            <h3>#2 - <u>Lack of Content</u>:</h3>
            <p>Say you can get past the empty world and lack of exploration and make it to the end game, what is your reward? 
                Is there any side quests worth doing or any side quests at all? 
                Guess the answer, I'll wait....Nope, nothing but the same old thing rehased and served in different variety, catching pokemon. 
                In the past we had the battle frontier, battle tower, battle zone, etc. 
                These days its like little to no effort was put in too after the game is over and all the pokemon is caught, but effort is the last thing we'll get on too.
            </p>
            <h3>#3 - <u>Cutting Corners</u>:</h3>
            <p>Speaking of effort, have you heard the whole dex isn't coming Sword and Shield, but wait it will be as Paid DLC. 
                A.K.A., "We'll take out over 400 pokemon and sell it back to you slowly." 
                With the excuse being updating existing models to they're best, not really tho, as reused assets have been found and datamined. 
                Worse than that is Scarlet and Violet, the bug-ridden mess that they are. 
                Given that pokemon is the worlds largest entertainment franchise there is, you would think quality is how they got there, but alas it is not.</p>
            <p>It is sad to see a gaming franchise that I once held in dear and high regard, fall so low and so far. 
                Despite it bad press and mistakes, it seems that no matter what problems they face or encounter, money is there primary focus. 
                Will there be a day where the Pokemon decide to make a good game? 
                or Will they forever churn through their fanbase for a dollar? Only time will tell.</p>

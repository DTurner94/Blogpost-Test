            <p>Written by Darius Turner</p>
            <h2>#1 - <u>Gameplay</u>:</h2>
            <p>Want gun gameplay that is rewarding difficulty and exciting variety, then Remnant is the game for you. 
                With many different ways to play from long-range, to mid-short, all the way to up in the bosses face. 
                There is a gameplay style for all to enjoy. 
                Play alone or with your allies in this fantastical epic that spans across many different battlegrounds and locations. 
                The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/617290/Remnant_From_the_Ashes/">DLCs</a> only expand on this crazy ride.</p>
            <h2>#2 - <u>Armor and Weapons</u>:</h2>
            <p>Want to mow do your enemies with Tommy gun, or blast them with a powerful shotgun, or charge in screaming "This Is Sparta!", go for it. 
                With many different weapons and weapon mods, ranging from healing yourself and allies, buffing yourself and your weapons, to summoning a sidekick to do battle with you. 
                Whats a good weapon without some stylish armor to rock with it. 
                There are many armor types that buff your preferred playstyle, what to dish out damage in the bosses face then you need some thickboy armor, we got you. Want hang back, be agile and take pot shots, we got you. 
                No matter your style of play we got you, looking fly and feeling powerful never felt so good.</p>
            <h2>#3 - <u>Enemy Variety</u>:</h2>
            <p>Now, now, now I know what you thinking, "What's the point if the enemies suck or there is too few of them?". 
                Well let me tell, there are 38 different bosses in the base game, 38. 
                Split between four biomes, each with their own set of interesting enemy types as well. 
                No repeat creatures to found here. 
                The DLC adds more biomes and even more crazy enemy varieties than before. </p>
            <h2>#4 - <u>Sequel</u>:</h2>
            <p>Now, if I hadn't sold you before guess what, it's getting a sequel later this month. 
                Adding on to the awesomeness that is its predessor and you got a wild ride in-store for you. 
                From balancing changes for single player to changes to the armor, many changes are giving this soon-to-be franchise enough air to thrive. 
                What dangers lurk aroung these corners? 
                What adventures are to be had? 
                And most importantly, where will you be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/Remnant_II/">July 25</a>?</p>
